## 💻 Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Vitest (Testing Framework)

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses Vitest for unit testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## 🐞 Debugging

This repository is configured for easy debugging with VS Code:

1. Open the file you want to debug
2. Set breakpoints where needed
3. Press F5 or click the "Run and Debug" button
4. Select the "tsx" configuration

The launch configuration is set up to:

- Use the "tsx" runtime for TypeScript files
- Display output in the integrated terminal
- Skip Node.js internals and node_modules in the call stack

## 📝 Problem Sources
